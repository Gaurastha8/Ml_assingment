 ML Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning assignment focusing on dataset exploration and linear regression.

## Assignment Details

### 1. Iris Dataset Exploration

- **Task:** Load the Iris dataset, display the first five rows, dataset shape, and summary statistics.
- **File:** `iris_exploration.py`
- **Description:** This script loads the Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`, displays the first five rows, and provides summary statistics including mean, standard deviation, and min/max values for each feature.

### 2. Salary Prediction

- **Task:** Fit a linear regression model to predict salary based on the `YearsExperience` feature.
- **File:** `salary_prediction.py`
- **Description:** This script uses sample data to train a linear regression model that predicts salary based on years of experience. It then evaluates the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on a test set.

## Files
